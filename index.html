											<h2>About</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Foundation models are quickly emerging as powerful tools to solve a variety of biomedical challenges, 
										such as clinical text generation and summarization, radiograph analysis, disease prediction, etc. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. 
										Foundation models are characterized by their ability to solve multiple prediction tasks across diverse domains. 
										These models are first pre-trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data, and then fine-tuned using task and 
										domain specific examples. This stands in contrast to the mechanistic approach to machine learning in healthcare, 
										which explicitly incorporates prior knowledge of physics/biology/chemistry into the models that are then refined 
										by training from data. While both these approaches have the potential to streamline healthcare administration, 
										reduce costs, enhance accessibility, and ultimately improve the quality of patient care, many questions remain 
										unanswered:</p>

											<h2>Submission Tracks</h2>
										</header>

										We invite submissions for two <b>non-archival</b> tracks: <b>Traditional</b> and <b>Non-traditional</b>.

										<h3>Traditional Track</h3>
										In this track, we seek outstanding papers which explore novel approaches or offer fresh insights into the core questions targeted by this symposium. Full papers can be up to 4 pages in length with unlimited pages for references and appendices. All submissions will undergo a <b>double-blind</b> review process, and authors are required to ensure proper anonymization of their submissions.

										Examples of similar tracks include the <a href="https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/call-for-the-special-track-on-ai-for-social-impact/">AAAI Special Track on AI for Social Impact</a>, <a href-="https://www.mlforhc.org/paper-submission">MLHC Research Track</a>, and <a href="https://ml4health.github.io/2023/call_for_participation.html">ML4H Proceedings track.</a> 

										<br>
										<p>
										<b>Dual-submission policy:</b> Papers submitted to this track should not have been previously published or be currently under review at any other archival venue. Nevertheless, given the non-archival nature of this symposium, authors are free to subsequently publish their work in alternative venues.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Non-traditional Track</h3>
										In this track, we seek all sorts of non-traditional research artifacts. We welcome submissions such as papers that describe software tools, datasets and benchmarks, clinical abstracts demonstrating the application of foundational models and machine learning to specific clinical challenges, or previously published research findings that can stimulate insightful discussions among the symposium attendees. Additionally, we invite position papers that address policy considerations for contemporary machine learning models within the healthcare context. We highly encourage submissions from student first authors. Papers in this track should be concise, with the maximum length of 2 pages and unlimited pages for references and appendices. The review process will be <b>single-blind</b>, i.e. the author names and affiliations can be included in the submissions. 
										
										Examples of similar tracks include the <a href="https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/student-abstract-and-poster-program-call-for-proposals/">AAAI student abstract track</a>, <a href="https://www.mlforhc.org/paper-submission">MLHC Clinical Abstract Track</a>, and <a href="https://ml4health.github.io/2023/call_for_participation.html">ML4H findings track</a>. 

										<br>
										<p>
										<b>Dual-submission policy:</b> Papers submitted to this track <b>can</b> be already published or under-review at any other archival venue. Furthermore, accepted papers can also be later published in another archival venue. 
										</p>
										
										<h3>Submission site</h3>
										<a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2024/Spring_Symposium_Series/Clinical_FMs">Openreview Submission Site</a>

										<br>
										<p>
										<b>Format:</b> Authors should follow the formatting guidelines outlined in the <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit24-2/">AAAI-24 Author Kit</a>. Depending on the track, please utilize the appropriate templates: Authors submitting to the traditional track should employ the anonymized templates (AnonymousSubmission), while those submitting to the non-traditional track should make use of the camera-ready templates (CameraReady).	
										</p>

										<h3>Supplementary Sections and Appendices</h3>
										<p>
										<b>Supplementary Material and Appendices:</b> Unlimited pages of supplementary materials such as appendices, proofs, and derivations may be attached to the paper. However, reviewers will not be obligated to review these materials, as part of the paper evaluation process. 
										</p>
										<p>We strongly encourage authors to include two additional sections into their submissions, when applicable. These two optional sections would not count towards the page limit, but should be limited to a maximum of 1 page each.</p>

										<p>
										<b>Ethical Considerations and Reproducibility Statement:</b> We urge authors to include a dedicated paragraph that addresses the ethical implications of their work. Furthermore, please provide a paragraph outlining the measures taken to ensure the reproducibility of your research. This section can also include links to anonymized code and data submissions. We recommend that authors familiarize themselves with the Ethics Statement and Reproducibility sections in the <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide">ICLR 2024 Author Guide</a>. 
										</p>

										<p>
										<b>Ethics Board Approval:</b> If your research involves datasets that necessitate Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval or its equivalent, please ensure that you mention these details in the camera-ready version for traditional track papers. For non-traditional track submissions, this information should be included at the time of initial submission. In the case of traditional track papers, at the time of submission, it is sufficient to include a statement indicating that relevant ethics approval information will be provided if the paper is accepted.
